# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
An anlysis of how different theater campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

By utilizing the Pivot Table and graphing functions, I was able to visualize campaign outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled) based on launch dates. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

With Excel functions, I created a table and graph to showcase the number and percentage of campaign outcomes based on goal dollar amount ranges. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. Overall, there are more successful plays than those that have failed or been canceled. Of the 1369 total plays, 839 of the plays were successful. Therefore, if you have a kickstarter for a theatre project, you will have a 61% chance of success. 
	2. The most successful months are May and June, where 65-67% of the kickstarters were successful. Whereas the least successful month is December, where 51% of the kickstarters failed or were cancelled. As a result, if you want the most success, it would be best to have a kickstarter in May or June. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	1. The goals that less that $15,000 are most likely to be successful. After the $15,000 mark, the likelihood of failed kickstarters for plays increased. 
	2. There are no cancelled kickstarters for plays. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
